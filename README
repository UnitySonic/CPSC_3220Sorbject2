Description: 
	This is a threading library that allows users to create user threads
	that can run their own thread functions.


Design:
	My threading library uses a linked list data structure to keep track of all the threads.
	This is rather slow, but ok for the purposes of getting a small scale library functional
	The library has access to locks and signals, albeit with a rudimentary implementation. It is
	also able to work in both cooperative and preemptive mode.

Known Problems:
	My library is rather buggy when it comes to pre-emtpive testing. I'm not sure why it's so buggy 
	to be honest. I think the interrupts block out printf messages randomly which makes it look like
	the program isn't working?
